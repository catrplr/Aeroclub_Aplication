Install a VM or dual boot your system with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, after successful installation install ROS Melodic Feel free to approach us in case of any problems regarding the installation and configuration
Once done with the installation, create a catkin workspace in ROS In your workspace write subscriber and publisher nodes in same package
Now that you know how ROS works on a ground level, identify some methods  by which we can implement vision into ROS so that we can program further
Assuming OpenCV is one of your answers for the previous question we would suggest you to get familiar with basics of openCV (you can use language of your choice C++/python) 
Now write an algorithm to import vision to ROS through your webcam using openCV and CVbridge and once successful, identify a geometric shape of your choice (triangle square pentagon etc..) 
Having identified your geometry try to differentiate between your  identified geometries (be it with respect to size or color etc……..) 
Clearly mention all the sources followed and assumptions made during the application process at the end 
Pack all of your codes into a GitHub repository and link it in your application and you can also choose to do a video demonstration of the openCV algorithm (bonus)
