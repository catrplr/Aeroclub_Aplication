Let’s get into some music, what’s your favorite song? Taylor swift or Kanye West? The Beatles or Pink floyd?Build a circuit on tinkercad using an arduino, buzzer, and push buttons which allows you to produce sounds of different frequencies,Now use the push buttons to play the basic tune of the song you selected. Submit the circuit schematic / image of circuit and the code. Instead of schematic, an ork file is as well accepted. A tinkercad sharing link as well is equally accepted. A screen recording video of you playing the tune would be really appreciated although not mandatory (brownie points)
